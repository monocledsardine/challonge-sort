# challonge-sort

Challonge Sort allows users to sort [CHALLONGE!](http://challonge.com) tournament 
brackets using algorithms that override traditional seeding rules.

Challonge Sort is currently in the early stages of development, and many features are 
not yet implemented. 

Features planned for development include

* Convenient import and export interfacing with challonge
* Generating a bracket with some unseeded players
* Seed-based sorting with user-customizable rules
* Smart match-making which allows players to be distanced from each other in early rounds
* Splitting large brackets into pools, and importing pool results into a new bracket
